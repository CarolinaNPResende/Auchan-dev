Retail E-Commerce Platform Developed in Salesforce

Here you will find some examples of Lightning Web Components (LWCs) developed by me for the project, using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
Due to contractual reasons, I cannot expose the entire project.

Project Description: Auchan E-commerce Platform | Diamant Client Customer Area

The development project of the "Diamant Client" Customer Area represents a significant milestone in strengthening the relationship between the company and its customers. Conceived as a centralized and intuitive platform, Diamant Client aims to offer customers a personalized and transparent experience, packed with innovative features and advanced functionalities.

About Diamant Client:

The "Diamant Client" Customer Area is a multifunctional digital platform designed to meet the diverse needs and expectations of the company's clients. With a user-centered approach, Diamant Client offers a wide range of features and services, providing convenience, autonomy, and simplified access to relevant information.

Key Features:

Personalized Account Management:
Customers have access to a comprehensive view of their accounts, allowing them to view detailed information about their contracted products or services, transaction history, outstanding invoices, and payments made. Additionally, they can update their personal information and communication preferences easily and securely.

Customer Support and Service:
Diamant Client offers a direct communication channel with the customer support team, allowing clients to log support requests, report technical issues, or ask questions about products and services. The integration of live chat and ticketing systems ensures fast and efficient responses.

These resources empower customers to troubleshoot issues on their own and educate themselves about the products and services offered by the company.


Developments in Lightning Web Components:

As an integral part of the project, I led the development of various components in Lightning Web Components (LWCs), using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with React logic. Some of the key developments included:

Account Viewing Component: Development of an interactive component for viewing and editing customer account information, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

Transaction History Component: Creation of a dynamic component to display customer transaction history, with advanced filtering and sorting features to facilitate analysis and tracking of financial activities.

Customer Support Component: Implementation of a customer support component, integrating live chat and ticketing system functionalities to provide proactive and personalized support to customers.

These developments in Lightning Web Components reflect my commitment to technical excellence and your ability to create innovative solutions that add value to customers and drive the success of the "Diamant Client" project.
